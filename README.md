**_Description_**

**Make It Poetry** is a generative poetry app built with Vue.js and PostgreSQL. The site allows users to input any source text and it ouputs a randomly generated "poem." The user is able to update the poem before it is posted on a general feed of all poems that have been created through the app.  

Currently, the generative poetry algorithm is a simple javascript function that scrambles the words in the text and randomly selects a set number to output into a single poetic form. I plan to continue to tweak the algorithm to make the forms more random and the language (slightly) less non-sensical.

**_Technologies Used_**

Vue.js, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

**_Future Updates_**

- Log-in ability so that users can view all their created poems and have protected access to their delete buttons.
- A more advanced generative algorithm.
- The ability to generate poems from ALL previous source texts combined.
