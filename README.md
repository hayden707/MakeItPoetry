**_Description_**

For my P4 I will be building a full stack poetry application using Vue, Express, and PostgreSQL. A user will be able to paste a text into an input field, which will randomize the language and reformat a portion of the source material into a few short lines of text to create a "poem." I will impletment Auth0 authentication so that Users will be able to save their favorite poems as a list, edit their generative poems, and delete the poems they don't like.

I will be styling with CSS.

**_Approach_**

I have mapped out the backend models and their associations with an ERD, as well as the front-end with a CHD. I created a plan for my project week using a Trello board (linked above)
