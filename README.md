**_Description_**

**Make It Poetry** is a generative poetry app built with Vue.js and PostgreSQL. The site allows users to input any source text and it ouputs a randomly generated "poem." The user is able to update the poem before it is posted on a general feed of all poems that have been created through the app.

**_Approach_**

I have mapped out the backend models and their associations with an ERD, as well as the front-end with a CHD. I created a plan for my project week using a Trello board (linked above)
